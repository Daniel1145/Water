# Water
Android app that allows users to keep track of their plants. Also reminds them to water their plants depending on the plant's watering 
schedule.

## Getting Started
The app is not yet fully completed and is not available as an apk or on the play store. But as it does have most functionality, it can
be installed and used through Android Studio.

Before you can install the app on your phone, you must ensure that USB Debugging in Developer options is enabled. Then, connect your phone
to your computer using a USB cable, and open up the Water project on Android Studio. Compile and install the project onto your phone, and
you should now be able to use the app on your phone.

## Todo
- Add notifications for when user has to water their plants
